### Image Processing 
Before the classification of numbers and symbols can be performed, the image needs to be preprocessed to allow uniform inputs into the neural network. The image will be denoised and reshaped using OpenCV, and segmented into its individual symbols. During this process, the segmented parts will be labelled to allow for reconstruction of the data after recognition, in which the order may be stored as an attribute to the symbols or numbers.

### Neural Networks
For ease of designing the neural network and to maximize time in optimization, I will be converting the images obtained into NumPy arrays, as NumPy arrays use less memory, along with the ease of performing matrix transformations and other mathematical operations, all of which will be immensely useful for the development of this project. I have chosen to use Convolutional Neural Networks to perform optical character recognition due to their efficiency in image recognition as they require less preprocessing of the input images and the abundance of resources available. One of the biggest advantages of Convolutional neural networks is the ability to capture spatial dependencies; where a pixel‚Äôs value is influenced by the value of nearby pixels; by applying ‚Äúfilters‚Äù to the image.

‚ñ≤An example of a CNN architecture used to classify clothing. I intend to implement a similar architecture. 

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) use filters, often called kernels, which are typically small matrices such as 3√ó3 or 5√ó5. These kernels slide over the input image, multiplying their values by the corresponding pixel values in the image region they cover. This operation extracts local features by sampling pixels within the kernel‚Äôs region. For example, a 3√ó3 kernel processes a 3√ó3 pixel area at a time.

The movement of kernels across the image happens with a fixed stride, which represents the step size between each sampled region. The values inside the kernels are weights that are optimized during training through machine learning algorithms like backpropagation.

A typical CNN architecture consists of several types of layers working together:

- Convolutional Layers: Apply kernels to detect features such as edges, textures, and patterns.

- Max-Pooling Layers: Reduce spatial dimensions by grouping and summarizing features, improving computational efficiency and translation invariance.

- Fully Connected Layers: Interpret the extracted features to classify the input into specific categories.

Libraries such as TensorFlow will be used for the training and development of the neural network, whereas training data will be sourced from Kaggle, which will be cited in the References section.
